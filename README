This is where all of my servers go.

Personal servers that come from a bunch of different VPS providers, and are
pretty much impossible to automate. Thus, more pet snowflakes instead of
disposable phoenixes. But my website is awesome! So ignore this. :-)

## Platforms

My servers are currently a combination of Debian 7, Debian 8 & Arch linux
machines. (And once systemd & OpenVZ learn to play nice together, I'll update
the older Debian boxes.)
